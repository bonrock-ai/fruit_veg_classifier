# fruit_veg_herb_classifier

We intend to build an App that can **recognize most fruits, vegetables and herbs** and provide most useful information for each individual 

- to improve health 
- to learn how to cook 
- to learn how to grow the plant
- to tell fun stories and to share cross cultural experiences

The 1st stage of this app use the following dataset
1. [Fruit 360 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits)
2. Common Chinese Fruits and Vegetables from Google Image search

In the future we will allow user to upload their images into the app, in order to make this app to recognize most fruits and vegetables. We will use both peer to peer review and automatic machine learning methods for quality control, making our service truful and accurate.
