# fruit_veg_classifier

We intend to build an App that can recognize most fruits and vegetables and provide most helpful information for each user to improve their health, to learn how to cook and to tell fun stories of their cross cultural experiences.

The 1st stage of this app use the following dataset
1. [Fruit 360 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits)
2. Common Chiese Fruits and Vegetables from Google Image search.

In the future we will allow user to upload their images into the app, in order to make this app to recognize most fruits and vegetables. We will use both peer to peer review and automatic machine learning methods for quality control, making our service truful and accurate.
